My hope is that this will take some of the anxiety out of math by introducing it trough something familiar that they already, through play, have an intuitive understanding of.",

Therefore, the room the audience enter is almost completly dark, except for the light shape on the floor, outlining the monuments dimensions very roughly. The sounds are likewise created to blend together and ease in and out smoothly. The sound design is based on recording from the actual monument, which produces a very low sound if you place the microphone inside one of the steel pipes."
